# Cinematic Bookings

This project is for our Applied Database System class. Our objective of this project is to build a relational database which will support an online movie ticket application. The database will be built using MySQL by Nelly Delgado Planche and Mahdia Rashid. For this project, our team will implement the login, browsing, and checkout functions. Using this application, you can purchase movie tickets online from local theaters. This service allows customers to receive information about movies currently playing and to reserve movie tickets ahead of time for specific screenings.
